:: Portal 2 Head Tracking - Uninstall
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - uninstall body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/uninstall-body.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: uninstall behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper. Everything below the
:: CONFIG BLOCK is copied verbatim from
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/uninstall-wrapper.cmd.

set "PLUGIN_SUBFOLDER="
:: Config and log files the mod writes at runtime, removed from wherever the
:: DLLs were deployed.
set "MOD_LEFTOVERS="
:: Files to remove from the game root. Only needed by a mod deployed BELOW the
:: root (see ASI_SUBDIR) that still resolves its config and log from the exe's
:: own directory.
set "ROOT_EXTRAS=HeadTracking.ini Portal2HeadTracking.log Portal2HeadTracking.prev.log"

:: --- Loader-specific config (leave the ones that don't apply blank) ---
:: MonoCecil: used to find + restore the original Assembly-CSharp.dll.
set "MANAGED_SUBFOLDER="
set "ASSEMBLY_DLL="
:: MonoCecil: marker the patcher injects; guards against capturing/restoring a
:: patched Assembly-CSharp.dll as the pristine .original backup.
set "PATCH_MARKER="
:: MonoCecil: extra files to also remove from MANAGED_SUBFOLDER (config/log
:: files left behind by the mod itself).
set "MANAGED_EXTRAS="
:: ASILoader: filename the ASI DLL was renamed to. Defaults to winmm.dll.
set "ASI_LOADER_NAME=winmm.dll"
:: ASILoader: subdirectory below the exe directory the payload went into. MUST
:: match install.cmd's value, or uninstall looks in the wrong folder.
set "ASI_SUBDIR=bin"
:: UE4SS: path under GAME_PATH holding the shipping exe. MUST match
:: install.cmd's value.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
