# Ultimate ASI Loader (vendored)

Bundled copy of Ultimate ASI Loader (x86), the install-time source of truth.
install.cmd copies it straight out of here and never reaches out to the network.
Refresh manually with `pixi run update-deps`, then commit.

`dinput8.dll` is extracted from the upstream x86 zip. install.cmd copies it
to <game>\bin\winmm.dll, the proxy slot Portal 2 loads ASI plugins through.

## Modified: third-party payload stripped

The upstream x86 loader carries three complete third-party DLLs as RCDATA resources,
so that a user who renames it over one of those libraries still gets the original
exports, plus the ini template one of them reads:

- `binkw32.dll` - RAD Game Tools, Inc., Bink and Smacker 1.994i. Proprietary
  middleware licensed per title; we have no right to redistribute it.
- `wndmode.dll` - DirectX Windower Embedded v2.3, (C) 2008 VEG, (C) 2004 menopem.
  No licence accompanies it.
- `vorbisfile.dll` - Xiph.Org, BSD-3-Clause. Redistributable only with its notice.

`scripts/strip-loader-payload.ps1` zeroes all three, and the windower ini template,
before the file is vendored. Only the `.rsrc` section changes: the loader code, its
imports, relocations and appended PDB are byte-identical to upstream. Nothing in this
mod can reach the stripped resources - the two library payloads are keyed off the
loader's own filename, and we deploy it as winmm.dll, while the windower needs a
`wndmode.ini` we never ship. MIT permits the modification; it is recorded here and in
THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md so this copy is not mistaken for stock upstream.
